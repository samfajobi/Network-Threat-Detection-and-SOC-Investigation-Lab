Building a Network Detection and Response System with Suricata and Zeek.


# Network Detection and Response (NDR) System using Suricata and Zeek

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **Network Detection and Response (NDR)** lab using **Suricata** and **Zeek**, two powerful open-source network security monitoring tools.

The goal of this project is to simulate **real-world SOC network monitoring**, where traffic is continuously inspected, suspicious activity is detected, enriched, and investigated, and actionable security insights are produced.

This lab mirrors how enterprise SOCs detect threats such as:

* Network intrusions
* Malware command-and-control (C2)
* Port scanning and reconnaissance
* Data exfiltration
* Suspicious DNS and HTTP activity

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Understand how **network traffic flows** through detection engines
* Learn the **difference between signature-based and behavioral detection**
* Gain hands-on experience with **Suricata (IDS)** and **Zeek (NSM)**
* Correlate alerts with rich network metadata
* Build SOC-ready investigation and analysis skills
